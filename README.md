## 🏛️ Project Overview

**IntelliCampus** is an enterprise-grade academic operating system built to modernize campus attendance, credential issuance, academic record keeping, and student support. 

### Core System Modules
1. **Smart Attendance & Multimodal Verification**: Dynamic 15-second rotating QR codes, Haversine GPS geofencing, and AI anti-spoofing facial recognition.
2. **Academic Grading & Multi-Tier Leave Workflow**: Draft/Publish marks lifecycle, HOD grade correction approval with cryptographic audit trails, and multi-tier leave approval pipelines.
3. **User Administration, Setup & Notices**: Bulk CSV ingestion with line-level validation, classroom geofence configuration, and targeted campus notices.
4. **Verifiable Credentials & Cryptographic Audit Ledger**: SHA-256 chained audit ledger ensuring immutable event logs, tamper detection, and public verifiable documents.
5. **AI Early-Warning System (EWS)**: FastAPI ML microservice identifying high-risk students based on attendance degradation, marks trends, and backlogs.

## 📡 Smart Attendance System Architecture

Full Specification: [**docs/ATTENDANCE.md**](docs/ATTENDANCE.md)

### Key Features
- **15-Second Rotating Dynamic QR Tokens**: Projector-friendly QR codes with epoch-based token rotation ($\lfloor t / 15000 \rfloor$) preventing replay attacks and proxy attendance.
- **Haversine Geofencing Boundary**: Mathematical spherical calculation ensuring student check-ins occur strictly within the classroom perimeter (default $\le 50$ meters) and rejecting unreliable GPS fixes ($> 100$ meters).
- **AI Face Anti-Spoofing & Liveness**: Evaluates facial cosine similarity and anti-spoof confidence; flags anomalous scores ($< 0.60$) for faculty manual review.
- **Session Lifecycle Governance**: Auto-closes expired sessions and marks unconfirmed students as `ABSENT` upon session finalization.

### Quick Start: Starting an Attendance Session
```bash
# Start live session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/attendance/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "facultyId": 1,
    "subjectId": 5,
    "divisionId": 3,
    "roomId": 7,
    "challengeCode": "K7Q2",
    "photoWindowMinutes": 10
  }'

# Fetch 15-second rotating QR token
curl http://localhost:8080/api/attendance/sessions/100/token
```

## 📚 Academic Grading & Multi-Tier Leave Workflow

Full Specification: [**docs/ACADEMICS_AND_LEAVES.md**](docs/ACADEMICS_AND_LEAVES.md)

### Key Features
- **Marks Lifecycle Isolation**: Enforces `DRAFT` status for in-progress grading (hidden from student profiles) until published by faculty.
- **HOD Grade Correction Sign-Off**: Mandatory $\ge 15$-character justification for mark changes, recording every approval or rejection on the SHA-256 chained audit ledger.
- **Multi-Stage Leave Approval**: Structured state machine: `Student Application` $\rightarrow$ `Mentor Recommendation` $\rightarrow$ `HOD Final Approval`.
- **Medical Certification Policy**: Mandatory certificate upload for absences longer than 2 days.

### Quick Start: Submitting a Leave Application
```bash
# Student submits leave request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/leave/requests \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "studentId": 10,
    "fromDate": "2026-10-20",
    "toDate": "2026-10-23",
    "reason": "Recovery from seasonal viral fever",
    "attachmentName": "medical_certificate.pdf",
    "attachmentUrl": "https://storage.intellicampus.edu/med/cert_10.pdf"
  }'

# Mentor recommends leave
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/leave/requests/501/mentor-review \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "approved": true,
    "approverId": 2,
    "status": "RECOMMENDED",
    "comment": "Doctor certificate verified."
  }'
```
